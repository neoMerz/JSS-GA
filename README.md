Production scheduling is one of the most important aspects of many companies, as an inefficient solution can directly affect production capacity and, therefore, profitability. When considering applications in problems of medium and large size, finding the optimal scheduling solution is hard. In this paper, we analyze a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimizing the scheduling of production systems. The algorithm integrates ad hoc genetic operators to avoid creating unfeasible solutions. Computational results shows that a methodology with approximate solution can achieve satisfactory results, comparable with optimal solutions.
